nodoc
=====

A documentation generator for Java with a __HTML5-based viewer__ (see picture below). Compatible with the JavaDoc documentation format, so documentation markup need not to be changed when switching to nodoc. Basically, you run it on your soure code and you get the same as with JavaDoc, just much nicer to browse, search and navigate through. 

_Work in progress_. Contributions, testing, feedback appreciated. I will make further documentation on how to use it available as soon as possible.

Intended to be language agnostic some day, and to also support other popular documentation formats, such as REstructured text, Doxygen, JSDoc and Markdown.
