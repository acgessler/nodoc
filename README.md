nodoc
=====

A __documentation generator for Java with a modern, HTML5-based viewer__ (see picture below). Compatible with the __JavaDoc__ documentation format, so documentation markup need not to be changed when switching to nodoc. Basically, you run it on your soure code and you get the same as with JavaDoc, but much nicer to browse, search or navigate. 

This is _Work in progress_. Contributions, testing and feedback are highly appreciated. I will make further documentation on how to use it available as soon as possible.

Intended to and designed for being language agnostic, and to also support other popular documentation formats, such as __REstructured text, Doxygen, JSDoc and Markdown__. Some day.
